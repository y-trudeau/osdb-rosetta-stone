# The opensource database Rosetta stone

While database engines like MySQL and PostgreSQL have a lot in common, performing even simple management tasks on one or the other can be challenging and time consuming.  The aim of this project is to provide a basis as how these databases works and how to accomplish key management tasks.

## Databases

As a starting point, the focus is restricted to [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) version 8.0.x and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) 12.x. Other opensource databases could be added in the future.  Keep in mind, this is a work in progress, the content will be enriched over time and it will need to be updated with the release of new versions of the databases.  Also, the goal is to provide a starting point, not to get lost with details.
